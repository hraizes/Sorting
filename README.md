Problem 1: A number of different sized pancakes are stacked. A sorted pancake stack is defined as having the smallest 
pancake on top, the second smallest pancake under the smallest pancake, etc. The only tool provided is a spatula that
will flip any top partition of the stack, including the entire stack. Note that there only ever exists one stack of pancakes, 
not multiple smaller, independent stacks. Larger pancakes may be on top of smaller pancakes and vice versa.

Problem 2: Implementation of bubble sort using simultaneous assignment. 

Problem 3: Implementation of merge sort without using the slice operator.
